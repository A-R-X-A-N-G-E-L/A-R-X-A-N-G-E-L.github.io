		<h3>Nightcore</h3>
		<div class="paragraphs">
			<p>A nightcore edit is a remix track that speeds up its source material by 20% and increases its pitch. Formed in 2002, the name for the internet-based music was originally defined as sped-up and pitch-shifted versions of trance, techno and eurodance songs, but its definition expanded into non-dance territory by the time the remix style became popular in the 2010s. The type of music that started as a subgenre of trance is still considered so by many people. Indeed, dedicated trance fans usually call it "happy nightcore" to indicate its "similar-but-different" nature.</p>
			<p>Nightcore is characterized by a speed-up melody (sometimes), fast rhythmic beat (usually), and higher than normal pitch.</p>
			<p>The first nightcore edit of a non-dance track was that of a track by rock band Evanescence, uploaded on YouTube in 2011. From there, the music rose in popularity with more and more users and YouTubers such as SkyDoesMinecraft applying the nightcore treatment to more non-dance genres such as pop music and hip-hop. Many of the pioneer uploaders of nightcore including Maikel631 have called these non-dance edits "fake". Fan Fiction, a journalist who wrote a feature about nightcore for Nest HQ, praised the expansion of nightcore to other types of music, but still felt there were many popular songs that were better off not having a nightcore version.</p>
			<p>Almost all nightcore music are original songs nightcored (remixed into nightcore) by nightcore fans.</p>
